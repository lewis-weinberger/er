.SH NAME
er \- terminal-based text editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B er
.I file...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B er
is a very minimal text editor.
It is not
.BR vi(1)
or
.BR emacs(1)
or
.BR acme(1).
You probably shouldn't use it.
.PP
.B er
requires filename(s) to be specified on the command-line;
If a path does not correspond to an existing file,
it will be created. Only 32 files can be edited
at a time.
.B er
implicitly assumes UTF-8 encoding for all I/O.
.PP
If
.B er
encounters an unrecoverable error it will attempt to
save the current buffer(s) to
.I 'er.out'
before exiting.
.SS Modes
.B er
is a modal editor with 2.5 modes: COMMAND, INPUT and SELECT.
.RS
.IP *
In COMMAND mode, input is interpreted as commands to control
the editor.
.IP *
In INPUT mode, character are inserted into
the text at the position of the cursor. In both COMMAND
and INPUT modes, the cursor addresses a single character
position in the text buffer.
.IP *
SELECT mode is effectively the
same as COMMAND mode, except that commands are performed on
a selection which can span multiple characters.
.RE
.SS Undo
Changes to the text buffer are recorded and can be undone.
Changes to cursor addressing are not recorded.
.SS Copy/Paste
There is a single 'yank' buffer into which selected text
can be copied, and from which it can be pasted back into
the buffer.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS Motions
In COMMAND and INPUT modes, any motions apply to the
single cursor address. In SELECT mode, motions apply
to the lead address of the selection. In the below
list, keys within square brackets are only
interpreted as motions in COMMAND and SELECT modes.

positions.

.RE
.SS "INPUT mode"

will be inserted into the text at the cursor position.
The following keys result in other behaviour:
.RS
.IP BACKSPACE

.IP DELETE
Delete the character at the cursor position.
.IP ESCAPE
Enter COMMAND mode.
.IP TAB
Tab inserts either 4 spaces or a \\t at the cursor position.
.RE
.SH BUGS
It's very possible that
.B er
will not function properly in your given terminal [emulator],
as it assumes a basic set of VT-style escape sequences.
.PP
Bugs can be reported at
<https://github.com/lewis-weinberger/er/issues>.
As
.B er
is intended to be a minimal editor, feature requests
will be ignored.
